# MachineLearning

This project servers as my exploration into the topics of machine learning. I aim to implement the following model architectures

- [ ] Multilayer Perceptron capable of identifying hand drawn numbers. Accuracy goal of 98%
- [ ] Recurrent Neural Network
- [ ] Convolutional Neural Network
- [ ] LSTM
- [ ] Transformer
